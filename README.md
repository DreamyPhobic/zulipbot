[@zulipbot](https://github.com/zulipbot) is a GitHub workflow bot for the
[Zulip organization](https://zulip.org) and its repositories. Written in
Node.js, the bot handles issues in the repository in order to create a
better workflow for Zulip contributors.

Its purpose is to work around various limitations in GitHubâ€™s permissions and
notifications systems to make it possible to have a much more democratic
workflow for our contributors. It allows anyone to self-assign or label an
issue, not just the core contributors trusted with full write access to the
repository (which is the only model GitHub supports).

**@zulipbot** is currently deployed on all repositories of the [Zulip
organization](https://zulip.org).

## Installation

To install a copy of **@zulipbot** on your own GitHub repository, please visit

## Usage

If you're using the [Zulip project
configuration](https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot/blob/master/src/zulip_project_config.js)

instructions](http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zulipbot-usage.html) on the

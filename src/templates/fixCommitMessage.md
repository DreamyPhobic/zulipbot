Hello @[author], it seems like you have referenced an issue in your pull request, but you have not referenced that issue in your commit message(s). When you reference an issue in a commit message, it closes the corresponding issue for Zulip maintainers once your commit is merged.

Please run `git commit --amend` in your command line client to amend your commit message description with `"Fixes #[issue number]”`.

Thank you for your understanding and you valuable contributions to Zulip!
